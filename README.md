# -Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
This is a AI project using Python. It's mainly used to determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs". Determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. The algorithms are: ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG.
