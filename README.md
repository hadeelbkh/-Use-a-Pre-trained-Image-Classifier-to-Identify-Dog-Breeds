# -Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
This is my attempt to solve the first project from Udacity Nanodegree in AI programming with python.
This is an AI project using Python. It's mainly used to determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs". Also, it determines how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. The algorithms used are: ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG.
